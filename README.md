# Multi Chain Faucet Project Documentation

## Tagline
**ChainDrip: A Unified Multichain Faucet Service for Web3 Developers and Testers**

---

## Project Overview
ChainDrip is a unified multichain faucet service designed for Web3 developers and testers. Instead of hopping between different faucet sites, ChainDrip provides a single portal to request testnet tokens across multiple blockchain networks. Built with cross-chain compatibility in mind, it supports EVM and non-EVM testnets, rate-limits by wallet and verified identity, and uses gasless relays or AI captchas to prevent abuse. It integrates with Self Protocol for identity verification and Push Protocol for request confirmations and wallet alerts.

---

## Key Features
- ✅ **Request test tokens across 10+ networks**  
  (e.g., Celo, Polygon, Base, Optimism, Sepolia, Arbitrum, Avalanche Fuji, Scroll, zkSync, Near Testnet, Solana Devnet, etc.)
  
- ✅ **Unified dashboard to track balances across all testnets**  

- ✅ **Self Protocol-based Sybil resistance**  
  (verified one-time claims per identity)

- ✅ **AI-powered spam detection and abuse prevention**  

- ✅ **Developer-friendly API for CI/CD test automation**  

- ✅ **Optional GitHub/Discord login for contributor-based rate boosts**

## Use Cases
- Developers testing dApps on multiple chains
- Hackathon teams needing quick access to testnet tokens
- QA engineers simulating multichain deployment scenarios
- Chain foundations looking to streamline faucet infrastructure
